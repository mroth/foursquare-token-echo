A simple website to echo foursquare user token from the URL hash. 

Why?  Foursquare doesn't seem to support access-token based oauth2, so for a CLI app you're going to need to get that user_token back from the web browser somehow.  This is a simple website that echoes it so the user can cut and paste.

### Example use in ruby

foo
